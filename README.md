# Capstone-Project

## About the game
This project is our capstone project for my university. It is a game where students can learn topics and solve questions about them. There is currently only one topic which is Circuit Boards and there are currently two different gamemodes. The first mode is the tutorial mode. The tutorial mode will teach the players/students the basics of the selected topic by making use of Gamification. The second mode is a multiplayer mode where players/students can solve questions together. The multiplayer mode requests the questions from the database. The use of a database is important beacuase there will also be a website which is meant for the teachers. On this website the teachers can add, edit and delete students or the question which are being asked in the game.

There are 3 different question types. The first one makes use of templates. These templates are models of the selected topic. In this case templates are different circuit board modesls. The second one is multiple choice. These question are asked on a blackboard. The player can select his answer via buttons. The third one is Fill in the blank question. These are also asked on a blackboard. The players/students can type in their answers via input fields.

We used Mirror as our network solution.
